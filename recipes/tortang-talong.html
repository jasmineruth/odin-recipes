        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This recipe is specifically how my sister makes Tortang Talong. It is significantly complex compared to the simple Tortang Talong recipe, which makes it more palatable and delicious.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>100g ground lean pork</li>
                <li>2 to 4 talong (eggplants), average-sized</li>
                <li>3 to 4 eggs, beaten</li>
                <li>4 tomatoes, minced</li>
                <li>1 onion, medium-sized, minced</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Broil eggplants until tender.
                <li>Once cooked, peel off the skin of each eggplant and retain the crown and the stem. Gently flatten the meat of the eggplant by using the back of a fork. Set aside.
                <li>Mince the onion and tomatoes.
                <li>In a bowl, combine the eggs, salt, pepper, onions and tomatoes then mix well.
                <li>Dip each eggplant into the mixture.
                <li>Fry over medium heat until all portions are golden brown. Drain oil with paper towels then serve.
            </ol>
