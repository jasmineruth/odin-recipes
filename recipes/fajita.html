        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>These easy chicken fajitas are a classic combination of seasoned chicken strips, onions, and peppers. The homemade fajita seasoning flavors the chicken and pepper mixture perfectly, and prep takes less than 15 minutes. You'll likely have most of the fajita seasonings in your pantry, and if you don't, they're all easy to find. Or you might choose to use a ready-made packet of fajita seasoning instead.</p>
            <p>The word fajita didn't appear in print until the 1970s, but the dish dates back to the early 1900s.1 Mexican vaqueros working in Texas probably made the first fajitas with grilled skirt steak.2 Still, the dish didn't gain popularity until 1969, when Austin meat manager Sonny Falcon served them at his concession stand in Kyle, Texas.2 Later that same year, fajitas were introduced by Otilia Garza on the menu of his Round-Up Restaurant in Pharr, Texas2. The restaurant's fajitas were served on the signature sizzling platter with flour tortillas, cheese, and various condiments. As fajitas gained popularity, several variations popped up, including versions featuring chicken, shrimp, and vegetables.</p>
            <p>Serve fajitas with warm tortillas and your favorite toppings. Guacamole, sour cream, cheese, sliced green onions, tomato salsa, and cilantro are excellent choices. Make the fajitas a complete, well-balanced meal with hot cooked rice and refried beans on the side, or keep it light and simple with a tossed green salad.</p>
