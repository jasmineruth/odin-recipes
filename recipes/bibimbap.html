        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine. Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who cannot handle the spiciness, like our children.</p>

                <li>4 cups cooked white rice</li>
                <li>4 teaspoons toasted sesame oil, divided</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon sesame seeds</li>
           </ul>
            <h3>Optional Ingredients</h3>
                <li>Â¼ cup gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li> 
                <li>2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided (Optional)</li>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.</li>
                <li>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.</li>
                <li>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
                <li>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</li>
            </ol>
